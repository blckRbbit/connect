Add Dependencies

```groovy
  allprojects {
        repositories {
            // ...
            maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        }
    }

    dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.blckRbbit:connect:Tag'
	}
```

## Examples

**Client**

```java
Connect connect = new Connect("0.0.0.0", 8007);
String request = "Hey, Connect!";
connect.write(request);
```


**Server**

```java
int port = 8007;
ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port);
Connect connect = new Connect(server);
String request = connect.read();
String response = "Hey, User!";
connect.write(response);
```

## P.S


If your server is multi-threaded, then in each separate thread it is recommended to close the connection with the command

```java
connect.close();
```

Connect can be used as an argument in a try-with-resources block.
